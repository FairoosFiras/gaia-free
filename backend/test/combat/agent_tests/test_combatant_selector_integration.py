"""Integration tests for CombatantSelectorAgent.

These tests use the actual LLM to verify:
1. Combatant extraction from scene context
2. Descriptive enemy naming (not just numbered)
3. Correct hostility determination
4. Player inclusion from roster

Note: These tests require the combatant_selector prompt to be in the database.
Run the migration first:
