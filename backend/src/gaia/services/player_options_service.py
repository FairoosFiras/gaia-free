Player Options Service - handles personalized options generation for multiple players.

This service coordinates generating options for each connected player:
- Active player (turn-taker): Uses ActivePlayerOptionsAgent with action-oriented prompt
- Secondary players: Uses ObservingPlayerOptionsAgent with discovery-focused prompt

Both agents are imported from gaia_private and use DB-centric prompts (no in-code fallbacks).
